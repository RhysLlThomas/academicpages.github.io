I am a Health Economist completing a Ph.D. at the University of Southampton. My speciality is in applying econometric methods to health-related research questions. I have a particular interest in health-related inequality and public policy, however, my job market paper has more of a behavioural focus.

Before starting my Ph.D. studies, I obtained a BSc. and MSc. in Economics both also at the University of Southampton. Between November 2018 and April 2019 I was on a secondment at the Department for Education (UK), where I spent some time researching school exclusions and factors associated with disadvantaged pupil performance.
